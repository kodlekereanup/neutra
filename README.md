# NEUTRA - FIRST SHOT AT WRITING A TEXT EDITOR FROM SCRATCH

Neutra, a simple text editor that can be used to reduce plagiarism of text by 
prohibiting copy-paste of text from the exteral environment

This is the C version. Will propbably port it to C++.

When submitting assignments, an RSA key will be generated by the
editor to make sure the text has been written in NEUTRA and not some
other word processor.
